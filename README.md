# Data-X Flask Final

This repo contains the code for part 3 of the final assignment in the Data-X Plaksha.

## Setup

To reduce repo size, some extra steps are required to verify the code:

1. Copy "data-x-plaksha/07a-tools-nlp-basics/data" to the "model-training" 
2. Install the necessary data science packages to run the notebook and pickle the model and vectorizer objects into the "app" folder
2. Other than that, just install app dependencies and run the app!
