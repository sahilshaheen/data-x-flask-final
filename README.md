# Data-X Flask Final

This repo contains the code for part 3 of the final assignment in the Data-X Plaksha.

## Setup

To reduce repo size, some extra steps are required to verify the code:

1. Copy "data-x-plaksha/07a-tools-nlp-basics/data" and install required packages (NOT requirements.txt but the packages in the notebook) to the "model-training" folder to verify training [OPTIONAL]
2. Install app dependencies (requirements.txt) and run the app!

**Note: The folder structure of the project has changed from the video for deployment purposes but there are no major changes**
